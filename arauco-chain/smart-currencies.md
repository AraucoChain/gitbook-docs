# Smart currencies

The growing advancement of stablecoins, Central Bank Digital Currencies, Real World Asset tokens, and other assets, has also involved actors and governments that are regulating their use or standards so that they are accepted across the board.

Smart Currencies is an Arauco Chain module that allows builders to create different types of tokens (stablecoins, CBDCs, RWA, among others) with different attributes that are compatible with regulations in different countries.

With Smart Currencies, you can create, mint, burn, send, buy, and many more actions on each currency that is available on the network, including its use in Decentralized Finance platforms, and any Web3 dApps.

Some of the attributes of this module that can be configured for each currency are:

* **Know Your Customer (KYC)**
* **Freeze / Unfreeze accounts**
* **Clawback**
* **And much more.**
