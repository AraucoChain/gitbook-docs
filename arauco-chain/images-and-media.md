# Fintech Functions

Arauco Chain will natively enable financial functions (Fintech functions) so that Fintechs, DeFintechs, and Decentralized Apps can create and use these components in services associated with transactions and payments. Some of these functions are:

* **Escrows**: Escrow is a contract between two parties to facilitate financial transactions. An impartial third party receives and holds funds, and only releases them to the intended recipient when conditions specified by the contract are met. This method ensures both parties meet their obligations. An escrow can be time-based (for the release of assets), conditional (based on some on-chain or off-chain action), or a combination of both.
* **Checks**: A check enables users to create deferred payments similar to personal paper checks.
* **Cross-currency payments**: Send payments in your currency and the recipient can receive them in their currency (no matter if it is fiat, crypto, or CBDC). This functionality is thanks to an AMM (Automated Market Making) built into the network.
* **Secret transactions**: Send and receive money online, but without revealing information to outside parties. Specially designed for corporate environments or where privacy is key.
* **Pre-authorized accounts**: Authorize or deauthorize your account to interact with other accounts, whether anonymous or KYC-approved accounts or to receive/de-receive unknown tokens.
* **And much more.**
