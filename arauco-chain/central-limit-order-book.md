# Central Limit Order Book

An on-chain **Central Limit Order Book** (CLOB) offers several significant benefits compared to centralized order books and liquidity pools on decentralized exchanges (DEXs). **Arauco Chain** will natively incorporate one, and here are some of the key benefits:

1. **Transparency**: All orders and transactions are recorded on Arauco Chain, allowing for a complete and transparent audit trail.
2. **Decentralization**: By not relying on a centralized entity, the risk of manipulation is eliminated and market integrity is maintained.
3. **Asset Custody**: Users maintain control of their assets all the time, using non-custodial wallets, reducing the risk of losing funds due to hacks or platform failures.
4. **Limit Orders**: Unlike liquidity pools, Arauco Chain's CLOB allows users to place limit orders, meaning they can specify the price at which they wish to buy or sell an asset.
5. **Efficient Price Discovery**: Arauco Chain's CLOB facilitates more efficient price discovery with lower slippage, as orders are directly matched based on supply and demand1.
6. **Resistance to Future Centralization**: Being on the Arauco Chain ensures that the exchange remains truly decentralized, with no centralized elements that can be exploited.
7. **Security and Privacy**: Transactions on the Arauco Chain are typically encrypted, which protects sensitive information and allows users to maintain their privacy.

**These benefits make on-chain CLOB on Arauco Chain an attractive option for traders looking for a secure, transparent, and efficient trading experience**
