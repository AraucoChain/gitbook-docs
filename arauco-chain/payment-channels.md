# Payment channels

Arauco Chain is not only a network for online Web3 applications, but also for offline environments that can take advantage of the benefits of a full Blockchain network, such as very low-cost (or gasless) payments, P2P payments, and many actions that must occur where Internet access is not possible (rural environments, shopping centers, card purchases, etc.).

With payment channels, only the first and last transaction is recorded on the network, the rest in any off-chain/offline channel (for disconnected environments).
